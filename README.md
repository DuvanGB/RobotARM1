# RobotARM1
Anthropomorphic type robot.
In this project, the programming of a robotic arm with 3 degrees of freedom of anthropomorphic type was carried out, by means of an Arduino microcontroller and its modeling in solidworks, to import each piece in a netbeans interface programmed in java, to see the movement of the arm in real time after giving it positioning in coordinates from the same GUI.
